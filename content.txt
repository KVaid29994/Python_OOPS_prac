Class and Object (Example)

In Python, a class serves as a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes 
(data) and methods (functions) that the objects instantiated from the class will possess. By combining data and behavior into a single entity, classes
enable encapsulation and promote the development of modular, maintainable, and scalable code.

''' class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model

    def display_info(self):
        print(f"This car is a {self.brand} {self.model}.")

# Creating an object
my_car = Car("Tesla", "Model 3")
my_car.display_info()
'''

- Why is python called Object oriented programming?

Python is recognized as an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language because it embraces the 
fundamental principles of OOP: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. 
These principles allow developers to model real-world entities as objects, promoting better 
organization, modularity, reusability, and maintainability of code. By supporting OOP, 
Python enables developers to write cleaner,more efficient programs that are easier to extend and debug.

- What are the advantages of OOPa in python?
 ---> You can create your own datatypes
 --->Modularity 🧩 Code is organized into classes and objects, making it easier to manage and maintain.
 -->Reusability 🔄 Once a class is written, it can be reused across multiple programs without rewriting.
 -->Scalability 🚀 Easier to scale large projects by organizing code logically.
 -->Data Hiding 🔒Protects sensitive data using encapsulation, allowing controlled access.
 -->Inheritance 🧬Allows new classes to reuse, extend, and modify behaviors of existing classes.
 -->Polymorphism 🎭 Same method can perform different tasks depending on the object — making code flexible and dynamic.
 -->Easier Troubleshooting 🛠️Bugs are easier to track and fix since functionality is divided into small, logical pieces.
 -->Real-world Modeling 🌎 Helps you model real-world entities naturally, making the design intuitive.
